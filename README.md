# Poggit Support
Use the issues for support

## Ask questions
Ask questions in the [Issues](https://github.com/poggit/support/issues) section. This also includes reporting individual misbehaviour.

These questions should only be about Poggit itself. For plugin-related problems, please use their issue trackers, or their chatroom on Poggit.

For critical problems such as security problems, please contact a Poggit admin ([SOFe](https://forums.pmmp.io/conversations/add?to=SOFe) or [Awzaw](https://forums.pmmp.io/conversations/add?to=Awzaw)) on PMMP forums via private messages. You may also DM us on Gitter ([SOFe](https://gitter.im/SOF3)).
