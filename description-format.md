# Poggit Plugin Description Formatting Guide
This guide is made for developers to write a better plugin description for their plugins on Poggit.

## 1. Do not include useless information.
A few common types of irrelevant information include:

### Existing information
Plugin name, tagline, icon, license, etc. are already in the page. You don't need to repeat the information.

### Development version information
Users only care about the release build. Don't promote your development build here, so don't put the Poggit-CI badge here.

## 2. Categorize your description into sections
Every section should start with a title (the line begins with a `#` and a space). Each section will be displayed in a separate
tab, and the title will be used as the tab name.

You may want to make a section for each feature, or you may use other methods of organization. Poggit does not force you how to
organize your data, as long as it makes sense to the reader.

## 3. Provide sufficient information
Do not assume users know what your plugin does. 

Do not just put a video there. Not everyone wants to watch a video. You may link to a video, but make sure readers who don't watch
video at least have an idea if your plugin will be helpful to them.

You may want to add different languages of description, but you must put an English version, because that's the official language
used in the whole Poggit website.
