# Plugin Submission Rules

## (A) About the plugin
These rules are about the idea of your plugin. Plugins with purpose violating these rules will never be approved.

1. The plugin must be fully functional, be complete and serve a purpose.
  - The plugin should be thoroughly tested before getting submitted.
  - The plugin must be useful to the many users. Do not submit your "private core plugin" or a plugin with very specific features that can only be useful to your own server.
  - If a plugin is too simple, it may be rejected. Try adding more features to your plugin if it is too simple.
  - If the plugin has many independent features, the user should be allowed to disable individual components through config file, commands or other convenient methods (telling the user to edit the plugin.yml is not a convenient method).

## (B) About the code
These rules are about the code in your plugin. Violating these rules may make your plugin rejected, and you will have to change your code and submit it again.

1. Plugins should follow [PQRS](pqrs.md).
2. The source code must not be obfuscated.
3. Plugins are not advised to show messages that merely indicate they have been enabled.
4. If the plugin is mostly based on another user's work, you must not submit it. If you want it to be available on Poggit release, please see [Poggit Orphanage](https://github.com/poggit-orphanage/office).

## (C) About the submit form
These rules are about the plugin submission form on Poggit. Violating these rules will require you to submit your plugin again.

1. The description must not repeat information displayed in other parts of the release page. See [Description Format Guide](description-format.md) for more information.
